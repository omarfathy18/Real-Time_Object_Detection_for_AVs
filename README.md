# Real-Time Object Detection for Autonomous Vehicles

This project implements a real-time object detection system for autonomous vehicles utilizing deep learning techniques. It is designed to identify pedestrians, vehicles, traffic signs, and obstacles under various conditions. The system includes model training, MLOps for continuous monitoring, and real-world testing to ensure safety and efficiency in self-driving applications.
